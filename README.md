Waymark Studio (WMS) is a total replacement for the in-game waymark editor and Waymark Preset plugin. Waymark Studio provides a suite of tools to make placing and loading waymark presets simple, fast, and accurate.

Features include:
1. Set up visual guides to place waymarks on a grid
1. Shortcuts to place waymarks on clockspots
1. Place draft waymarks in duty recorder and during combat
1. Save and Load presets outside of instances (open world, Eureka, Bozja, etc.)
1. Mouse hover preset preview
1. Place from a suite of packaged community created presets
1. Import waymarks from FFLogs reports
1. Seamlessly share waymarks between Criterion Normal and Savage
1. Create triggers to automatically load presets when entering a dungeon region

> [!CAUTION]
>Use at your own risk.
>
> Waymark Studio tries to prevent you from accidentally placing illegitimate (floating or out-of-bounds) waymarks, but it is possible in some scenarios. Square Enix can detect and punish those who illegitimately place waymarks (https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/news/detail/1e7aea492d72d81e2b3dbcfcdd3dacf07111126b).
>
>While you're unlikely to be detected or punished, if you want to place illegitimate waymarks and plan to spread them in Party Finder, it is safer to create the preset with an alt account and place it in PF parties before using it on a main account.
>
> Waymark Studio allows you to save and place presets within the open world or instances where presets are not supported by the game. Placing these presets will be slower and distance limited by default to be undetectable. You can disable safety checks for these presets in the settings to place them immediately and at any range. With this disabled, preset placement will be obviously impossible and be theoretically detectable; use at your own risk.

## Drafts
Waymark Studio uses a special form of waymarks called 'draft' markers.
Draft markers are only visible to you, show the precise size of a marker, and can be placed in combat or duty recorder.
Once you place your draft markers as desired, you can convert them to real waymarks or save them as a preset with a single button press.
By default, WMS will place real waymarks if possible and fallback to draft markers, but it can be configured to always place draft markers by unchecking "Place real markers if possible".

## Guides
Guides are customizable line grids that you can place on the arena to help you place waymarks at precise positions; they are only visible to you. WMS provides two types of guides (circular and rectangular) to operate on typical FFXIV boss arena shapes. WMS has shortcuts to place draft waymarks at clockspots on the guide.

## Share and Import
To share a preset, right click the preset and click share to copy it to your clipboard. It will be a URL like [`https://sourpuh.github.io/waymarkstudio?preset=wms1.ADsDd8-JAvysC-DIB5PIBfysC6bDAfS0AfysC6jDAYggkK4L_vAEp7MEkK4LgPEEz4kCkK4LsG0ET3ptYQ.e1IJ7Q`](https://sourpuh.github.io/waymarkstudio?preset=wms1.ADsDd8-JAvysC-DIB5PIBfysC6bDAfS0AfysC6jDAYggkK4L_vAEp7MEkK4LgPEEz4kCkK4LsG0ET3ptYQ.e1IJ7Q).

You can open a preset URL to see a map preview. If you want to import the preset, copy it to your clipboard and click the import button.

To import a preset from FFLogs:
1. Copy a report URL to your clipboard. It should look something like `https://www.fflogs.com/reports/dY98jQtfJkAWLaZ3?fight=16`.
1. Press the blue gem button to begin the import.
1. If your URL does not have a `fight=N` parameter, you will be prompted to choose a fight from the report.
1. A chat message will indicate whether or not the import succeeded.
1. FFLogs does not provide "height" coordinates for waymarks, so WMS determines height for you when you enter the corresponding zone.

## Community Presets
WMS contains a set of community presets from https://github.com/Em-Six/FFXIVWaymarkPresets/wiki. If you have a preset that you want to include in community presets, follow the support process to suggest the preset.

To view available presets, visit https://github.com/sourpuh/ffxiv_waymarkstudio/wiki/community_presets or open the plugin's libarary window and open the "Community" tab.

## Triggers
Triggers are cylindrical regions that automatically load presets when you enter them. Triggers were designed for criterion dungeons so you can place a trigger before each boss to automatically load their presets when you need them.

To use triggers:
1. Open the trigger editor window with the 'üèÅ' button. Press 'Place Trigger' to begin creation.
1. Left-click to place a trigger on the ground. The checker bordered circle shows the trigger's location and size.
1. Adjust the trigger's name, position, and radius.
1. Select a preset to attach.
   * If you don't have a preset yet, you can still create the trigger and attach one later.
1. Save the trigger. Once it is saved, it will appear in the studio window above your presets.
1. Every time you walk into the trigger, it will load the attached preset.
