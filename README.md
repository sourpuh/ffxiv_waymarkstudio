# Waymark Studio

Waymark Studio (WMS) is a total replacement for the in-game waymark editor and Waymark Preset plugin. Waymark Studio provides a suite of tools to make placing and loading waymark presets simple, fast, and accurate.

Features include:
1. Set up visual guides to place waymarks on a grid
1. One-click place waymarks on clockspots
1. Place waymark placeholders in recordings and during combat
1. Save and Load presets outside of instances
1. Mouse hover preset preview
1. Download community created presets from Codex (planned)
1. Seamlessly share waymarks between Criterion Normal and Savage (planned)
1. Automatically load presets when entering an instance or dungeon region (planned)

WMS is still in development and may be unstable. As far as I know, the plugin does not allow you to do anything detectable or bannable, but there is no guarantee. Use at your own risk.

## How to install and use
1. Add custom repository `https://puni.sh/api/repository/sourpuh`
1. Search for `Waymark Studio` in the plugin installer and install the plugin
1. WMS can be accessed via the Plugin Installer or using the chat command `/wms`
